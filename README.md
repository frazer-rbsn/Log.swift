# Log.swift

Simple *static* logging class in Swift, with an API based on Android's `Log`.
Log output is asynchronous.
Configurable timestamps, emoji and output to log file.
- If you want log output to a file, please set `logFileLocation`.

### Use
No need to add this as a package dependency, I'd recommend just copying the file and customising it yourself.
Think of it as a basic, batteries-included template for making your own logging class.
